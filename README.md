# WillsMediaServer
## WMS will rewritten again but this time into NodeJS. This is to simplify the development as the font end and backend will be both using javascript and GraphQL is supported way better on NodeJS than Python. Also, the server should arguable be faster ðŸ˜‚

Please take a look at the [WMS Wiki](https://github.com/WillsMediaServer/WillsMediaServer/wiki) for updates and prototype design images.

~~Current documentation on planned v1 api: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/WillsMediaServer/WMS-API/1.0.0~~
Now using GraphQL instead of REST/HTTP API so the API docs ^^ will not be used
